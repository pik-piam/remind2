## Purpose of this PR



## Checklist:
I checked the tests when running buildLibrary and made sure that my changes
- [ ] do not create new complaints about summation checks.
- [ ] do not create new complaints about missing variables that are expected in the piamInterfaces package. (If needed, adjust piamInterfaces mappings based on the [README.md](https://github.com/pik-piam/piamInterfaces/blob/master/README.md#renaming-a-piam_variable). In case of complaints unrelated to your changes that you are unable to fix, please open an issue in piamInterfaces.)
