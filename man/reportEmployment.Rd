\usage{
reportEmployment(
  gdx,
  improvements,
  multiplier,
  subtype,
  share_manf,
  decline,
  type
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdx}{A gdx file output from a REMIND run}

\item{improvements}{Either "None", "CEEW", "Dias", "Rutovitz_aus","Solar_found" or "All". Use "All" for all improvements.}

\item{multiplier}{controls how the regional multiplier for non-oecd countries changes with time.}

\item{subtype}{Subtype for how shares of solar rooftop, wind offshore, and small hydro are assumed in the future. Options "current", "irena", and "expert". See calcDspvShare for more information.}

\item{share_manf}{Either "current" or "local". Current implies current shares of world manufacture remain same until 2050, current means that in 2050 all countries manufacture required components locally.}

\item{decline}{How should the employment factors change over time? "capcosts" means according to capital costs. "static" means it doesn't change}

\item{type}{either "created" or "per_year". The former outputs jobs created in that year whereas the latter outputs total jobs in that year}
