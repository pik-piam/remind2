\title{Read in GDX and calculate prices, used in convGDX2MIF.R for the reporting}
\usage{
reportEnergyInvestment(
  gdx,
  regionSubsetList = NULL,
  t = c(seq(2005, 2060, 5), seq(2070, 2110, 10), 2130, 2150),
  gdx_ref = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdx}{a GDX object as created by readGDX, or the path to a gdx}

\item{regionSubsetList}{a list containing regions to create report variables region
aggregations. If NULL (default value) only the global region aggregation "GLO" will
be created.}

\item{t}{temporal resolution of the reporting, default:
t=c(seq(2005,2060,5),seq(2070,2110,10),2130,2150)}

\item{gdx_ref}{a GDX object as created by readGDX, or the path to a gdx of the reference run.
It is used to guarantee consistency before 'cm_startyear' for investment variables
using time averaging.}
